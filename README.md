# Pinch

This is the third app created as a part of SwiftUI + SwiftData Masterclass - iOS App Development Swift course projects. New things that I learned in this second project:
- Gestures: this app uses geatures a lot, and I learn many things about gestures from tap, drag, and also magnification gesture.
- SwiftUI's component: I learned more about components, and also backgrounds such as .ultraThinMaterial background.

Thank you so much for Robert Petras for this project and teachings!
